# Hello!
I'm Lon, a biomedical data scientist on the PRIME-TR team at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. As part of PRIME-TR, my research focuses on the human side of the microbiome's interaction with cancer development and response to therapy. I analyze transcriptomic and genomic data to understand the different pathways at work in tumor and immune cells in response to microbes or each other. 

I have a PhD in biomedical sciences with a concentration in Therapeutics and Pharmacology from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Houston Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. My dissertation work involved creating algorithms and pipelines to aid in clinical decision-making for personalized-medicine approaches.
