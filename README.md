# Hello!
I'm Lon, a biomedical data scientist with interest in health-related problems. 

I am completing my PhD in biomedical sciences with a concentration in Therapeutics and Pharmacology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. My dissertation work involves creating algorithms and pipelines to aid in clinical decision-making for personalized-medicine approaches. Here on my GitHub profile, I share some of my projects, including [implementing network-based scoring functions in R to predict drug efficacy in individual patients](https://github.com/alonzowolfram/network-scores), [discovery of potential ubiquitinases and deubiquitinases of oncogenes](https://github.com/alonzowolfram/ubiquitination-genes), and a [novel algorithm for clustering short peptides based on their sequences](https://github.com/alonzowolfram/peptide-clustering). 

Other projects are coming soon, including an XGBoost machine-learning model for drug-combination efficacy prediction, and pre-processing of individual patient gene-expression data for personalized-medicine applications. Please check back for updates!
